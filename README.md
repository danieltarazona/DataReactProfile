# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
